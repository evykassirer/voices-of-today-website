                Voices of Today is a youth organized festival for young and
                emerging artists. A festival cannot run without the help of
                amazing volunteers like you. We are looking for volunteers who
                are also community members / community organizers.</p>

                <p className={css(ST.paragraph)}>
                Volunteer incentives! Volunteering will get you tickets to
                another show of your choice. Note that not all volunteer
                positions will allow you to watch the show you are volunteering at.
